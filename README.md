This is the beginning of a project that I work on occasionally when I have free time away from school and work (very busy). I am learning to use WebSockets and APIs to produce dynamic tables.
My intention is to use historical data along with technical analysis techniques to generate buy and sell alerts for the crypto currencies I like and eventually add some stock tickers in as well.
